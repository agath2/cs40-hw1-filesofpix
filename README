Acknowledgements: 
    TAs, 
    geeksforgeeks, stackoverflow for explanations of functions in the string
    library. 

Correctly implemented: 
    We successfully implemented the readline.c file and the restoration.c file.
    The readaline file allocates memory onto the heap to read a line from an 
    input file and store it in the allocated memory. It also uses readaline.h.
    The restoration.c file uses the functionality readaline to de-corrupt a 
    corrupted image file and print it in its pgm format. 

Incorrectly implemented:
    We did not correctly implement the strnlen and strcpy function in the 
    <string.h> library, which caused invalid read errors when running 
    valgrind.

Time spent: 
    70 hours
